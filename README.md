📈 AI Investment Bot — Documentation
Overview

This project is an automated investment analysis and simulation bot designed to:

Analyze stocks and ETFs

Generate BUY / SELL / HOLD signals

Simulate trades using realistic broker rules (Revolut)

Track portfolio performance over time

Continuously improve decision confidence using historical backtesting

⚠️ Important:
This bot does not place real trades. It is a decision-support and simulation tool.

🧠 How the Bot Works (High Level)

On each run, the bot:

Downloads recent market data for each asset

Calculates technical indicators

Evaluates BUY vs SELL signals

Applies a confidence score (0–100)

Simulates trades using Revolut rules

Updates portfolio state and performance files

Stores all decisions and outcomes for learning and analysis

📊 Assets Covered
Stocks

Top US large-cap companies (e.g. AAPL, MSFT, NVDA, AMZN, META…)

ETFs

Broad-market and sector ETFs (SPY, VOO, QQQ, VTI, XLK, VT, etc.)

Broker Assumptions (Revolut)

✅ Fractional shares allowed for stocks

❌ Fractional shares not assumed for ETFs

❌ No leverage

❌ No short selling

💸 Broker fee applied to every trade

📐 Indicators Used

The bot uses technical analysis, not fundamentals.

1️⃣ RSI — Relative Strength Index

Measures overbought / oversold conditions

RSI < 30 → potential BUY

RSI > 70 → potential SELL

2️⃣ EMA (20 & 50)

Detects short-term vs medium-term trend

EMA20 > EMA50 → bullish momentum

EMA20 < EMA50 → bearish momentum

3️⃣ MACD

Measures trend strength and momentum

MACD > Signal → bullish

MACD < Signal → bearish

🎯 How Decisions Are Made

Each indicator contributes to a score.

BUY vs SELL Scoring

RSI signal → 25 points

EMA trend → 25 points

MACD signal → 25 points

Remaining 25 points come from historical accuracy (backtesting)

Final Decision

BUY → higher buy score

SELL → higher sell score

HOLD → no clear advantage

🔢 Confidence Score (0–100)

Every decision has a confidence score:

Calculated from indicator alignment

Adjusted by historical success rate

Used to filter weak trades

Example:

Confidence < 65 → ignored

Confidence ≥ 65 → allowed to trade

This prevents overtrading.

🔁 How the Bot Improves Decisions
Backtesting

For each asset, the bot:

Looks at historical signals

Checks what happened 5 days later

Measures how often BUY and SELL were correct

Uses this accuracy to weight current decisions

This creates a feedback loop:

Signals that historically worked matter more.

📉 Why the Bot Can Lose Money

This is expected and normal.

Reasons:

Markets are noisy and often inefficient

Simple indicators don’t work in all conditions

Fees reduce edge

The bot avoids unrealistic assumptions

📌 A losing bot is more honest than a fake profitable one.
